# Website_Solutions
Welcome to the "Website Solutions with Client-Server Architecture on Linux" repository! This project is designed to provide practical, hands-on experience in building robust and scalable website solutions using a client-server architecture based on Linux. Our focus encompasses various key components, including configuring the storage subsystem, setting up WordPress, and implementing a three-tier web application architecture with a shared database and a load balancer solution. All seamlessly orchestrated on Amazon Web Services (AWS) Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances.

Key Features:

1, Client-Server Architecture: Dive into the world of client-server architecture, where we explore the synergy between client-side and server-side technologies.

2, Storage Subsystem Configuration: Learn how to work with disks, partitions, and volumes on a Linux operating system to create an efficient and reliable storage subsystem for web and database servers.

3, WordPress Installation: Follow step-by-step instructions to install WordPress and connect it to a remote MySQL database server, ensuring a secure and robust content management system.

4,Three-Tier Web Application Architecture: Build a scalable and resilient web application architecture with a clear separation of presentation, application logic, and database layers. Shared Database: Set up a single MySQL database server to serve as the centralized data store for your web application, enabling data consistency and reliability. NFS Server for Shared File Storage: Implement a Network File System (NFS) server to provide shared file storage, facilitating seamless data access and collaboration among your web servers.

5, Load Balancer Solution with Apache: Explore load balancing techniques using Apache web server to distribute incoming traffic evenly across multiple web servers, ensuring high availability and performance.
